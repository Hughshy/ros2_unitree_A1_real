# ros2_unitree_A1_real
Control unitree A1 though ros2 foxy on Ubuntu 20.04.   

This package can send control command to A1 robot from ROS2 and receive real-time sensors from robots. You can do low-level control(namely control all joints on robot) and realtime display A1 joint angles from ROS2 by subscribe `joint_states` topic .  

This version is suitable for  `unitree_legged_sdk v3.3.3`, namely A1 robot.

Due to limited time, I have not developed the upper level control. Welcome to explore and develop together!
